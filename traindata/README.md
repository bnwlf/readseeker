# Train Data
## Data Generation

The traindata for the readseeker model where generated using an jupyter notebook named [readseeker_generate_train_test_data.ipynb](readseeker_generate_train_test_data.ipynb). The RefSeq reference data where pulled at 25.03.2024.
## Data Files
The original training and testdatasets (traindata.zip) generated by jupyter notebook can be downloaded from our zenodo repository (`10.5281/zenodo.12699064`). `train.tsv.gz` represents the training dataset and dev.tsv.gz represents the used test dataset during the training process. ****Notice*** to use these datasets with the original `DNABERT` scripts, the files must be extracted from the zip and gz compressed state.
